 * to be run should not use the service framework.

 * Services will not often do not block, but if they
 * do they must indicate so, so the service handler may
 * handle the service appropriately.  A check for
 * blocking is only made a single time, changing the
 * return value will do nothing after initialization
 * for the {@link ServiceHandler} class.
